Authored Timezone
=================

Authored Timezone allows you to specify a custom timezone for the 'Authored on'
field. This is useful when content is written in different timezones. Each piece
of content can display its authored/submitted/created date in the timezone from
which it was written. You can also, optionally, display the author's country in
the 'Submitted' information.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Enable the Timezone option on the content type(s) of your choice and,
  optionally, display the author's country.

- Add/edit content. The timezone will default to your current location, but can
  be changed as desired.
